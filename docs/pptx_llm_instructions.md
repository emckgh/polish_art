# Instructions for an LLM: Build the Polish Looted Art Discovery Engine Funding PowerPoint

Use this document plus the **screenshot images in this package** to construct a single PowerPoint presentation. The deck is a high-level overview aimed at **museum directors and Polish ministry officials** to summarize the project and spur potential funding.

---

## Purpose and audience

- **Purpose:** Summarize the Polish Looted Art Discovery Engine—a system that uses technology to find where looted Polish art appears online (auctions, marketplaces, galleries) and surface leads for experts and restitution.
- **Audience:** Museum directors, Polish government (e.g. Ministry of Culture, Division for Looted Art). Tone: professional, credible, concise.
- **Goal:** Communicate intent, capability, and impact in a way that supports partnership and funding discussions.

---

## Design and style (mandatory)

The presentation must look like a **professional consulting deck** (McKinsey, Bain, or similar). Apply these rules strictly.

### Overall look

- **Muted, tasteful palette.** No bright or national-flag blocks of color. Prefer off-whites, light grays, and charcoal for text.
- **Clean typography.** Clear hierarchy: slide title, then body. Plenty of white space; avoid clutter.
- **Modern headers and footers.** Every content slide has a thin horizontal line separating header from body, and a footer with project name and slide number.

### Colors (use these or very close)

- **Background:** Off-white or very light gray (e.g. RGB 248–252 for backgrounds). Optionally, a **single tasteful artwork image** from the project database used as a **very muted, washed-out full-slide background** (e.g. blended with white so it is barely visible). If you cannot use a DB image, use a solid light background only.
- **Slide titles:** Dark charcoal (e.g. RGB 33, 33, 36). Bold. Left-aligned.
- **Body text:** Dark gray (e.g. RGB 70, 70, 76). No red or bright accent in body.
- **Lines / rules:** Thin (about 1 pt) light gray (e.g. RGB 200, 200, 204).
- **Footer text:** Medium gray (e.g. RGB 100, 100, 108), small (e.g. 9 pt).

### Layout

- **Margins:** Consistent horizontal margins (e.g. 0.6"–0.7"); comfortable top margin below any header line.
- **Title area:** Left-aligned title; a **thin horizontal line** directly under the title area (no thick colored bar).
- **Footer (every slide except possibly title):** A thin horizontal line near the bottom, then one line of text: **left** = “Polish Looted Art Discovery Engine”; **right** = slide number (e.g. “2 | 5” or “2 of 5”). Small, gray font.
- **No large colored rectangles** behind titles (no full-width red or blue bars). Restrained, corporate style only.

### Slides and images

- **Total:** 5 slides.
- **Screenshots:** On the slide titled **“The Platform”**, include **two application screenshots** provided in this package. Use the files **screenshot_list.png** and **screenshot_detail.png** from the zip. Place them on the right side of the slide (or in a clear two-image layout). Keep the left side for 3–4 short bullet points (see content below). Do not distort the images; keep aspect ratio and readable size.
- **Optional background:** If you have access to an image from the project’s artwork database, you may use **one** artwork image as a full-slide background, heavily faded (e.g. 85–90% blend with white) so it stays tasteful and does not compete with text. If not available, use a solid light background only.

## Slide-by-slide content

Build exactly **5 slides** with the following content.

---

### Slide 1 — Title slide

- **Title (large, left-aligned or centered, charcoal):**  
  **Polish Looted Art Discovery Engine**
- **Subtitle (smaller, gray):**  
  **Recovering Cultural Heritage Through Technology**
- No footer required on this slide (or use same footer style as others for consistency).

---

### Slide 2 — Challenge & Mission

- **Title:** Challenge & Mission  
- **Thin line** under title.  
- **Body (3 bullets):**
  1. Hundreds of thousands of Polish works looted in WWII still circulate online.
  2. Recovery today is manual and slow.
  3. We use technology to find where looted art appears—auctions, marketplaces, galleries—and surface leads for experts and restitution.
- **Footer:** “Polish Looted Art Discovery Engine” (left) | slide number (right).

---

### Slide 3 — The Platform

- **Title:** The Platform  
- **Thin line** under title.  
- **Left column — body (3 bullets):**
  1. Reference database from official sources (e.g. Division for Looted Art).
  2. Reverse image search at scale; prioritizes auction and marketplace hits.
  3. Web UI for curators to browse, search, and review leads.
- **Right side — two screenshots from this package:**
  - **screenshot_list.png** — Shows the main **artwork list** screen: table with thumbnails, search, filters, and Vision API status. Use this image as the first/upper screenshot.
  - **screenshot_detail.png** — Shows an **artwork detail page** with image, metadata, and Vision API results (or similar tabs). Use this as the second/lower screenshot.
- **Footer:** “Polish Looted Art Discovery Engine” (left) | slide number (right).

---

### Slide 4 — Impact & Next Steps

- **Title:** Impact & Next Steps  
- **Thin line** under title.  
- **Body (3 bullets):**
  1. Prioritized leads, low cost, scalable to tens of thousands of artworks.
  2. Pilot with ministry or museum partners; secure funding for API and capacity.
  3. Extend: public reporting, official DB integration, stronger restitution workflows.
- **Footer:** “Polish Looted Art Discovery Engine” (left) | slide number (right).

### Slide 5 — Thank You

- **Title:** Thank You  
- **Thin line** under title.  
- **Body (1 line):**  
  We seek partners in museums, government, and cultural institutions to scale impact and accelerate restitution.
- **Footer:** “Polish Looted Art Discovery Engine” (left) | slide number (right).

## Screenshot reference (images in the zip)

- **screenshot_list.png**  
  The application’s main list view: a data table of looted artworks with columns such as image thumbnail, title, Vision API status, artist, year, status, last known location, and description. There may be search, filters, and pagination. Use this to show “the platform” list experience.

- **screenshot_detail.png**  
  A single artwork’s detail page: larger image, metadata (title, artist, year, etc.), and tabs or sections such as General, Perceptual Features, Similar Artworks, and Vision API Results. Use this to show depth of the platform (detail + Vision/search results).

When building the PowerPoint, **insert these two PNG files** into Slide 3 (“The Platform”) so the audience sees the real application. Preserve image quality and aspect ratio.
